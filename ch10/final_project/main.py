import pygame
import tkinter

root = tk()

# import your controller --> this part of the code will call pygame to come into the tkinter program 



def main():
    pygame.init() ok i think tkinter stuff goes here 
    # Create an instance on your controller object
    # Call your mainloop

    ###### NOTHING ELSE SHOULD GO IN main(), JUST THE ABOVE 3 LINES OF CODE ######
