#collection objects 
##lists - list of any set of objects 
#tuples - immutable lists of any set of objects 
#mytuple=(list of integers )
#whats the point of tuples: faster than mutable lists 
#dictionaries-- used to store key/value pairs 
#mydictionary = {"a":1,"b":2 , "c":3}
#mydictionary["a"]

#while- more control over the loop, runs the loop until a condition is met

iterating variable must be able to change
